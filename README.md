## What does this mod do?

When toggled (with `v` by default) your armor will stop rendering (including elytra and carved pumpkins).

If you shift and press the toggle key (`V` by default) all player armor will stop rendering (including elytra and carved pumpkins).

This mod works on vanilla servers too! This mod is only required by and only works on the client.

**Disclaimer:** Most servers have rules against the use of mods. I am not liable if you use this mod on a server that bans client side mods.

## Configuration

The configuration file is located at `.minecraft/config/armor-visibility.json`.

The default config file:
```json
{
    "version": 2,
    "hide_my_armor_toggle": true,
    "hide_all_armor_toggle": true,
    "show_join_message": true,
    "keep_elytra_visible": false
}
```

The only options a player should touch are:

`show_join_message`: Whether to print to chat when joining a world if armor visibility has been toggled.
`keep_elytra_visible`: Whether elytra should stay visible when armor visibility is toggled.
