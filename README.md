## What does this mod do?
When toggled with 'r' by default, after placing a block it will randomally switch your active hotbar slot to another block.
This lets you automatically 'shuffle' between blocks when placing them quickly.

This mod is completely **client-side** and will work on vanilla servers.

***Disclamer:** Some servers have rules against mods! Make sure it is allowed on the server before using it.*
