## What does this mod do?
When toggled (with `r` by default), after placing a block it will randomly switch your active hotbar slot to another block.
This lets you automatically 'shuffle' between blocks when placing them quickly.

This mod is completely **client-side** and will work on vanilla servers.

**Disclaimer:** Most servers have rules against the use of mods. I am not liable for any rule breakers.
